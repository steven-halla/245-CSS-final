                        <h2>Why react Native</h2>
                        <p>
                            I love programming with React native for a lot of reasons. First mobile uses a more modern approach, compare to HTML which is old and outdated. Mobile is also more secure than web. With React Native itself, the code applies to both IOS and android at the same time, you only have to worry on library conflicts at times so it's worth it.</p>

                        <h2>Why React</h2>
                        <p>
                            One of the things that I love with modern functional component React is the hooks. Handling state is a breeze, whether it's global or local state. There isn't a bunch of boiler plate code, like with Redux, so your code will look cleaner. Other hooks include useEffect, which will perform functions as the webpage loads.</p>

Armed with a flower helmet and leaf shield, Barry approached. The bees, intrigued by his outfit, decided to negotiate. In exchange for fashion advice, they offered Barry honey. It was the beginning of a bizarre friendship. Barry became the bees' stylist, and the forest buzzed with well-dressed bees, proving that diplomacy can be found in the most unlikely places."

Luna decided to communicate with the moon by creating patterns with her fellow sheep in the field. Farmers and passersby were puzzled by the elaborate formations.

Though the moon remained silent, Luna's imagination inspired the village to appreciate the beauty above, uniting them under the stars."
